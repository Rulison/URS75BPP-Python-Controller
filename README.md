URS75BPP-Python-Controller
==========================
Python code for controlling URS75BPP stage rotation device.  I made this because Newport makes their files very hard to find, and the files themselves aren't well-documented.

Drivers file is for version 2.6 and is publically available, but hard to find.  The controller file is based on their sample code, but with a lot of fixes to make it work with recent firmware versions.
